1) Coding style.
   - Use explicit "!= NULL", "!= 0", etc. This makes code easier to read and
     remove warnings on some platform. Don't forget SPACES before and after
     the comparison operator.
     Example:
	BAD:
		if(a) 
	BAD:
		if(a!=NULL)
	GOOD:
		if(a != NULL)
	GOOD: 
		if(a != 0)
   
   - Put figure brackets '{}' even if you have only one operator
     in "if", "for", etc. This also makes code easier to read and 
     saves a lot of time when you need to quickly change something. 
     Example:
	BAD:
		if(a != NULL) 
		     message(G_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE, "Ko");
	GOOD:
		if(a != NULL) {
		     message(G_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE, "Ok");
		}
    
    - Use round brackets '()' for "return". 
      Example:
	BAD:
		return 0;
	GOOD:
		return(0);
    
    - Check for memory leaks.
